For those interested in a basic firewall which does most of what is needed here is a basic script. The comments within should be descriptive enough. If not consult your local man page or drop a comment here. If you aren't familiar with various port numbers consult your local /etc/services...

{% gist poerhiz/ %}

The above script is an amalgamation of scripts rolled and cut down to one script.

For those without 'large' screen resolutions I apologize for the run off.
