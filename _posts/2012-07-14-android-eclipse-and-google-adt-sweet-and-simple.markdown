Typically setting up ones development environment is the most painfully step when you are 'getting started coding'.

Google however has streamlinded this process making things 'point-and-click' simple! (About time eh?!)

To get started cranking out android code follow googles quick setup guide found <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html" title="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

After you have setup your environment lets walk through a simple application which is a few steps beyond the basic 'hello world'.
This application that is going to be developed will be a white noice maker (There are not any good white noise makers/sleep machines on google's play store so lets write one).

Since you are completly new (yes, making that assumption) to the android scence and haven't the faintest clue where to begin, lets start over at <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html" title="http://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html" target="_blank">Android Developer Central</a>...

After awhile your eyes start glazing over so lets makes this painless... we are interested in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html" title="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioManager.html" target="_blank">audio manager</a>

After a little more searching you might find a few code snippets here and there about android development...like this <a href="http://www.droidnova.com/creating-sound-effects-in-android-part-1,570.html" title="http://www.droidnova.com/creating-sound-effects-in-android-part-1,570.html" target="_blank">one</a>.

To keep things simple, <a href="http://10byte.com/downloads/sleepgood.tar.gz" title="http://10byte.com/downloads/sleepgood.tar.gz" target="_blank">here is the complete project</a>. Now go read some code!
