<strong>D</strong>etection of Spam is difficult due to its nature of origin. Spammers and Spam filters are in an ever escalating war of numbers. Spammers need a certain filter avoidance success rate in order to ensure their profit margins are either meet or exceeded. Spam filters on the other hand are constantly trying to detect what could be Spam, quarantining those messages, and hoping they didn't queue a valid message. Taken to an extreme: if Spam filters didn't exist, businesses would lose profits due to employees inability to parse thousands of messages for valid communiqué. Spam filtering is a need for some businesses to operate efficiently. We are only going to focus on targeted Spam which is created to bypass filters. Since nearly all none targeted Spam can be filtered it is of no consequence.

<strong>A</strong> better solution to current practices of Spam filtering would be to employ a frequency analysis technique on the occurrence of letters, specifically those with low occurrence frequencies. Let us assume that if the letter e appears it will do so x percent in valid communiqué and y percent in Spam. By comparing frequency statistics from the following domains: past messages, the language which the messages were written in, and past Spam messages database; statistics can be drawn upon to assess the probability that a message is not Spam.

<strong>B</strong>y looking to past messages before looking at language for gathering frequency statistics, the accuracy by which a filter can determine the validity of a message will increase. This increase in accuracy marking targeted Spam will occur due to the nature of language, personal vernacular, and demographic vernacular. For example, I am an English speaking citizen living in North America, more specifically the United States. My day to day correspondence with others on the Internet consists of a specific frequency set of letters which if compared to a Spam message coming from Asian origin will have larger discrepancies than that of a message coming from an origin like north Europe which will have larger discrepancies than those of a message which came from someone from the city I live in.

<strong>U</strong>sing the discussed method in tandem with the following, a communiqué is valid when: it is marked valid by the recipient, doesn't match a current database of messages received and marked as Spam, and has a normal frequency distribution of letters compared to demographic statistics. By collecting and comparing frequencies of letters within a language per set of demographic information and doing analysis of Spam messages marked within those demographics detection would be more accurate. This method coupled with current techniques would mitigate if not eliminate messages from unverified sources which are Spam.
